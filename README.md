It is a global food retailer that specializes in offering a wide range of food products, including wine, meat, fish, sweets, fruit, etc. The company strives to provide high-quality products to customers in various parts of the world, inclusive of America, Canada, France, Russia, and Germany. Their sales channels are mainly websites, catalogues, brick and mortar stores, and dealers.

II. Project Review

In order to launch promotional campaign 6 to increase brand awareness and attract more customers, the company needs to perform a data analysis to measure the effectiveness of the previous 5 marketing campaigns, to identify the latest sales trends, to optimize its product offerings, and to make adjustments accordingly.

III. KPI that iFood company tracks:

●	Sales growth: the average revenue growth from 2018 to 2022 is used to measure whether the company achieved its sales targets compared to the previous fiscal years and how well it performed its market strategies.

●	Bottom line: the analysis of profits helps the company to evaluate its financial success and determines which marketing strategies they are going to take for the coming few years according to evolving social and environmental trends.

●	Product portfolios: the analysis is done by categorizing products based on their market growth and market share, which could better provide insights for the iFood to target their customers.     

●	Consumer demographics: iFood company tries to identify their customer purchase patterns and trends through analyzing their incomes, marital status, and age.

●	Sales Channels: iFood uses multiple sales channels to sell products, including brick and mortar stores, catalogues, deals and websites. The sales-channel analysis shows which channel outperforms the others.

●	Customer Satisfaction: this analysis measures which sales channels and which campaigns consumers complain about most, which will help the company further improve their operations and performance to meet the customers’ expectations.

V. Conclusion:

Based on the analysis above, we discovered that consumer purchase patterns shifted significantly during and after the pandemic. More and more people tend to do online shopping, so the target customers of Campaign 6 are going to be the families who cook and prepare meals by themselves for the health and nutrition concern in North America and frequently shop online. 
We will do both traditional advertising and digital marketing because website and stores are the two main sales channels. For traditional advertising we will launch a series of campaigns like TV commercials, in-store promotions, and community engagement. 
As for digital marketing, we will do media marketing: leverage popular social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat to showcase the brand's products in a fun and engaging way, such as recipe sharing and taste storytelling on our websites and social media to strengthen old customer loyalty and acquire new customers.
